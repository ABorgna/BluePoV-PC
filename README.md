The BluePov driver for PC
=========================

BluePoV is a persistence of vision display, just some leds rotating at ~2400rpm creating the illusion of a floating image, communicated over bluetooth with a pc or an android device.

This driver allows any program written in Python to send it a pixel matrix asynchronously, and configure some variables.

The display, developed over 8 weeks, is the final project of the Argentinian Pio IX secondary school.
